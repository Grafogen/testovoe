# Features of the calculator

```
If you need to count two numbers, you should click on the '=' button.

If you need to calculate a long expression from several arguments,
you can click on the signs at once and you will immediately see
the result of the previous calculation, for example-
You clicked '1'_'+'_'4'_'*' ,you will see '5*', where 5-result 1+4
and then click on the button by which you want to multiply the result,
for example 7. After that click = and you will see the result.

if the result is too big and does not fit into the line,
you can scroll it horizontally after clicking on it

P.S.
Priority of multiplication and division over
addition and subtraction is not implemented,
because I wanted to create such functionality)


If we talk about changing the theme of the calculator,
since no specific design was included,
I implemented the usual change of theme
from light to dark and back.
For example, I used the result of the Google
extension "Dark theme - Dark reader for Chrome"
in the example in the technical specifications
and took all the styles and colors from it.
